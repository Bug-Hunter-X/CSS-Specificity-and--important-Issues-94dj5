To address the specificity issues, it's vital to understand the CSS cascade and write more organized and maintainable CSS.

Avoid `!important` as much as possible and refactor the CSS to use more specific selectors without it. Prioritize maintaining a clean and logical structure for your CSS.

For the example provided, one better solution would be to use more specific and descriptive class names, removing unnecessary style conflicts and thus removing the need for `!important`. 

```css
/* Solution - More descriptive and specific classes */
.blue-text {
  color: blue;
}

.red-text {
  color: red;
}

.green-text {
  color: green;
}

.purple-text {
  color: purple;
}
```
This approach avoids overriding styles using `!important` and makes the CSS much easier to maintain and understand.
