# CSS Specificity and !important Issues

This repository demonstrates common yet often overlooked CSS bugs related to specificity and the use of `!important`. These can lead to unexpected styling behavior and maintenance headaches. The `bug.css` file contains the problematic CSS, while `bugSolution.css` offers improved alternatives.

## Issues:

* **Specificity Conflicts:** Understanding CSS specificity is crucial. Inconsistent specificity may cause styles to be overridden unexpectedly.
* **Overuse of `!important`:**  Over-reliance on `!important` breaks the natural CSS cascade and makes debugging and maintaining code challenging.  It should be used sparingly or avoided altogether.
